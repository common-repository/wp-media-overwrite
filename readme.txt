Replaces files automatically which have the same file name and are stored within the same folder

== Description ==

WordPress does not overwrite files that have the same name. Instead, it appends a number or random value at the end of it to make it unique: 
*filename.png will be turned to filename-1.png*

If you do not want that, this plugin is for you. Instead of adding it as a separate file, it will replace the file if it is within the **same folder**.
Here's a list of all the available features: 

= Features =

* Overwrite files that have the same name within the same folder
* Compatible with Windows Azure integration and other plugins
* Custom setting to automatically copy the data from the old file (Title, Caption, Alt text, description, metadata)

**PLEASE NOTE: After a file is replaced, the old file is still visible within the media window. Once you refresh, it is gone.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the plugin, by default, copy the old file data? =
